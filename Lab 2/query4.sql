/*
4.4 Query 4 subscriptionInterval  is an attribute in SubscriptionKinds.  The end date of a subscription can be computed by adding its subscriptionStartDate
to the subscriptionInterval for its subscription kind.   But when you add a DATE and an INTERVAL, the result is a TIMESTAMP (not a DATE).
If you have a TIMESTAMP value myTimestamp, then one of the ways that you get the date from that TIMESTAMP is by writing DATE(myTimestamp).
Write a SQL query which finds all subscriptions where:
• the subscription starts on or before December 17, 2022,
• the subscription ends on or after October 3, 2023,
• the address of the subscriber who has that subscription isn't NULL,
• the subscription kind (which is identified by subscriptionMode and subscriptionInterval) is still being offered (stillOffered), and
• there has been at least one hold (in Holds) placed on the subscription.

Attributes which should appear in your result as subscriberPhone, subscriptionStartDate, subscriptionEndDate, subscriberName and subscriptionRate,
where:
o subscriberPhone identifies the subscriber for the subscription,
o subscriptionStartDate is the start date of the subscription,
o subscriptionEndDate is the end date of the subscription,
o subscriberName is the name of the subscriber, and
o subscriptionRate is the rate for that kind of subscription.

No duplicates should appear in your result.
